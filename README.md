# Python-and-ML-Structural-Analysis

### Store Sales Analysis
This project demonstrates Structural and Descriptive Analysis for a store sales dataset.
### Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about store performance, including metrics such as store size, items available, daily customer count, and total store sales. The dataset is structured as follows:

### Feature Name	Description
Store_ID	- Unique identifier for each store
Store_Area	- Size of the store in square feet
Items_Available	- Number of items available in the store
Daily_Customer_Count	- Average daily customer footfall
Store_Sales	Total - daily sales in monetary value

### Key Analysis Steps
Data Loading and Inspection
Imported data using Pandas and validated the structure with .head(), .info(), and .describe().

### Descriptive Analysis
Explored spread using statistical metrics like mean, median, skewness.
Checked for missing values.

### Outlier Detection and Visualization
Used boxplots and histograms to detect outliers across all numerical features.
Visualized individual feature distributions to identify skewness to check if transformations is require (e.g., logarithmic).
Correlation Analysis

Generated a correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.
Used scatter plots and Seabornâ€™s pairplot for visualizing pairwise feature correlations.

### Key Insights
Identified features with strong correlations to sales, such as Daily_Customer_Count.
Visualizations
Pairplots to show feature correlations.
Boxplots and histograms to detect and visualize outliers.
Correlation matrix for understanding feature relationships.


### Future Work
Build predictive models for sales forecasting using machine learning techniques.
Optimize feature engineering for enhanced model performance.
